# Survival of Cardiovascular Heart Disease-CHD
To determine the factors that are most influential in patientsâ€™ survival of CHD. I created a **Logistic Regression model** in **R** using **RStudio** to predict the survival of CHD patients. **Extracted** the **data** from the **PHIS database** using **SQL**; built **tableau dashboards**. The **model predicted the survival of CHD** with an **AUC of over .90** and indicated that a higher **EF % is a major factor**.

# Data 
* The study is based on 299 patients of Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CHD) comprising of 105 women and 194 men. 
* All the patients were more than 40 years old, having left ventricular systolic dysfunction and falling in NYHA class III and IV. 
> Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CHD) was diagnosed by cardiac echo report or notes written by physician. 
> The information related to risk factors were taken from blood reports while smoking status and blood pressure were taken from physician's notes.

Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CHD) is now top reason causing 31% of deaths globally. Pakistan is also included in the list of countries where prevalence of CHD is increasing significantly. According to report by Al-Shifa hospital, 33% of Pakistani population above 45 has hypertension, 25% of patients over 45 years suffer diabetes mellitus, and CHD deaths in Pakistan has reached about 200,000 per year i.e. 410/100,000 of the population). All this results in increased prevalence of heart failure. Rate of heart failure patients in Pakistan is estimated to be 110 per million. Rising stress of economic and social issues in the modern era, greasy food with little exercise results towards increased prevalence of heart failure in Pakistan.
The main objective of this study is to determine the factors that are critical for survival among Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CHD) Patients by using data from Faisalabad (third most populous city of Pakistan).
