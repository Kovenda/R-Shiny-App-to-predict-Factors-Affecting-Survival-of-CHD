# Survival-of-Cardiovascular-Heart-Disease-CHD-
To determine the factors that are most influential in patientsâ€™ survival of CHD. I created a Logistic Regression model in R using RStudio to predict the survival of CHD patients. Retrieved the data from the PHIS database using SQL &amp; built tableau dashboards. The model predicted the survival of CHD with an AUC of over .90 and indicated that a higher EF % is a major factor.
